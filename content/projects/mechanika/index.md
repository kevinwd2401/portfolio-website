This 2D rhythm-oriented bullet hell was my first Unity game, and I was one of two programmers in a group of five people. Although the game may have been a bit overscoped, being an amalgamation of the ideas of all 5 of us, I am pretty satisfied with how the game turned out.

I was responsible for game design and map layouts, and I implemented the NPC enemies, including the two super-difficult rhythm-oriented bosses. It was here where I'd say I fell in love with game design and ignited my passion for programming NPC behaviors.
