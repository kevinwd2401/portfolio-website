This horror game challenges players to navigate maze-like levels, solve puzzles, and reach the exit points while avoiding hostile entities hidden in the dark.

I was responsible for the monster NPCs, level layout, and lighting. Each of the three different types of creatures feature unique mechanics and behaviors. For example, one of them investigates the sounds of the player's footsteps, and another only moves when out of the player's line of sight, making for suspenseful gameplay. My work on lighting and post-processing shaders help reinforce the eerie horror aesthetic.
