For the Stylized Scene project in my (CIS 5660) Procedural Graphics class, I created a _Madoka Magica_-inpsired animated scene. I created a main stylized toon shader and many other decorative shaders to use within the scene, including a stop-motion water shader.

To add to the scene’s chaotic yet melancholic atmosphere, I implemented multiple full-screen post-processing effects, including a hand-drawn, scribble-style outline shader, as well as other custom visual effects.
