[Catanks](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3793790/Catanks/) is UPGRADE’s 2024–2025 semester project, released on [**Steam**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3793790/Catanks/) as a top-down arcade tank shooter where you battle the numerous NPC rat tanks. As **producer** and one of 2 lead developers, I worked closely with 10+ programmers and coordinated the game’s asset and production pipelines.

I was responsible for most of the **core game design planning and game mechanics programming** during the first half of development, before shifting my focus to developing the Classic Mode inspired by Wii Tanks during the second half. This included implementing advanced **enemy AI** and **pathfinding systems** using state machines and **bullet-dodging behaviors** to give the players a meaningful challenge.

I designed and implemented over **30 unique enemy types** with different attacks and behaviors (all featured in Classic Mode), created the majority of the **VFX** present in the game, and contributed to **lighting and various shaders** throughout the project.
