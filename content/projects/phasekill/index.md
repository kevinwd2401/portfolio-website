This short stealth puzzle game was created for a game mechanics prototyping assignment in a game design course. I use an overexposed, minimalist visual style, placing the focus on the unique central mechanic of "phasing" between multiple map layers. I aimed to make the phasing mechanic feel satisfying as possible, employing multiple post-processing shaders and satisfying audio effects.
