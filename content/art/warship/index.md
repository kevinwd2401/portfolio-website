I love WWII naval history, so as a modeling exercise, I created an accurate base model of the WWII destroyer *IJN Shimakaze* using original blueprint schematics as reference. The asset was modelled for distant renders, with detail intentionally limited at the base-model level to prioritize efficiency. All modeling, texturing, lighting, and volumetrics were done in Maya.
