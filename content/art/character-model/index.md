I created this stylized original character to gain hands-on experience with the 3D character production pipeline. The base mesh was modeled in Maya, then transferred to Blender for sculpting, texturing, and rigging.

Multiresolution sculpting was used to refine surface details, while the Hook and Surface Deform modifiers were applied to the cloak and accessories, such as the earring, to add physics and secondary motion while being controlled by the armature.
