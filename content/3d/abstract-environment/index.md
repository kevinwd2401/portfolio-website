In this 3D environment render, I explore an abstract space unconstrained by gravity or fixed orientations. The base assets were modeled in Maya, with lighting, composition, and character posing done in Blender, with assistance from my friend Yichen Huang. I also used this piece as an opportunity to experiment with volumetric fog to enhance depth and atmosphere.
